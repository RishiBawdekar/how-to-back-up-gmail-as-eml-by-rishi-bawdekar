How does it works?\r\n\r\n1. Download the zip file. Extract contents to _www_ directory of WAMP. (See Section 2). Rename the folder to _SaveGMailAsEML_.\r\n2.

They can be viewed using Windows Live Mail or Windows Mail 10.\r\n\r\nThe time limit for receiving data from Google is 30 seconds (which is adjustable). If time exceeds 30 seconds, then the email is saved without attachment.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to run the program while keeping the console window open.
